# Social-Capital-Atlas

### Introduction

Social capital – the strength of our relationships and communities – has been shown to play an important role in outcomes ranging from income to health. Using privacy-protected data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook, Raj Chetty, Matthew 0. Jackson, Theresa Kuchler et. al, measure three types of social capital in each neighborhood, high school, and college in the United States:

- Economic Connectedness: The degree to which low-income and high-income people are friends with each other
- Cohesiveness: The degree to which social networks are fragmented into cliques
- Civic Engagement: Rates of volunteering and participation in community organizations.

The creators used data of Facebook users between the ages of 25 and 44, who reside in the United States, were active on the Facebook platform at least once in the prior 30 days, have at least 100 U.S.-based Facebook friends, and have a non-missing residential ZIP code as of May 28, 2022 to create their database and various other statistical columns that I will be talking about further. 


### Methodology

- Conducted Data Cleaning and performed Exploratory Analysis on a substantial dataset using Python
- Utilized Clustering and Classification techniques to delve deeper into the dataset and examine its intricate connections
- Created visual representations of different variables to assess the robustness and nature of their interrelationships
