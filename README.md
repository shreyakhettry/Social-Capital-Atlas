# Social-Capital-Atlas

### Introduction

Social capital – the strength of our relationships and communities – has been shown to play an important role in outcomes ranging from income to health. Using privacy-protected data on 21 billion friendships from Facebook, Raj Chetty, Matthew 0. Jackson, Theresa Kuchler et. al, measure three types of social capital in each neighbourhood, high school, and college in the United States:

- Economic Connectedness: The degree to which low-income and high-income people are friends with each other
- Cohesiveness: The degree to which social networks are fragmented into cliques
- Civic Engagement: Rates of volunteering and participation in community organizations.

The creators used data of Facebook users between the ages of 25 and 44, who reside in the United States, were active on the Facebook platform at least once in the prior 30 days, have at least 100 U.S.-based Facebook friends, and have non-missing residential ZIP code as of May 28, 2022, to create their database and various other statistical columns that I will be talking about further. 

When I was going through the codebook support document, I noticed that everything in the document is divided on the basis of the three types of social capital and I decided that I would also be structuring my analysis in a similar manner and explore my data-based on the different social capitals at the county level. I want to answer an exploration question: “Are the different variables for the different social capital types interconnected?” My initial thoughts are that most of them should be but I will explore this question throughout my project as my analysis is primarily based on this.
For my analysis, I decided to use the ‘County-Level Data’ file (I will upload the CSV with my submission). It has 26 columns and 3089 rows.

I believe that I was able to answer my exploration question to some extent as I did discover various relationships between the various social capital variable types. This dataset has so much more to offer and in the future, I could further analyze more states, compare relationships between various states, analyze more columns, connect to the other data layers such as zip, high school and colleges and analyze them in relation to one another and the social capital types.

### Methodology

- Conducted Data Cleaning and performed Exploratory Analysis on a substantial dataset using Python
- Utilized Clustering and Classification techniques to delve deeper into the dataset and examine its intricate connections
- Created visual representations of different variables to assess the robustness and nature of their interrelationships
